## Disclaimer

I'm by no means skilled in creating grafana dashboards, nor do I have aesthetic sense. This dashboard was created primarly for my personal needs.

## Data source

I use Victoriametrics as my default data source in dashboard, so maybe you will have to modify it to suite your instance e.g. prometheus for example.

## Mailcow exporter used
